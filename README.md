# 📝 Simple To-Do List App

A basic To-Do list app built with React. It allows you to add, toggle, and delete tasks. The app uses `useReducer` to manage state for handling task actions. 

**Note:** The styling is minimal, as this project focuses on functionality and state management rather than design.

This was a great learning experience for working with React's `useReducer` hook and handling simple state updates.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
